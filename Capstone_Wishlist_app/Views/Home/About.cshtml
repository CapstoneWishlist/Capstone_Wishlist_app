<p>The end of year holiday season is historically a difficult time for impoverished families that want to provide happy memories for their children. This system is designed to help those children by facilitating gift-giving by charitable donors to children in need. In addition, the system will track and manage information for the charity organization that oversees the donation process. </p>
<br />
<p>The system is support software for an existing charity organization. This organization may have a web page; however donations currently are accepted through a physical donation center only. The organization wishes to expand by offering online donation services. As an added feature to make the experience more personal, they wish to allow some families to upload requests that donors may purchase specifically for the requesting family.</p>
